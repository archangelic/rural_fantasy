<p>small town refuses to celebrate halloween. they say it's because of religious reasons, but in reality, they can't face the ghosts. they don't want to invite their accusations.</p>

<hr>
<p>the swamp creature takes its child trick-or-treating every year.</p>
<hr>
<p>RJ mumbles something under his breath, takes a short puff of his grape cigarillo and walks off to the back. He returns with a Bud Light and a Coors Light in his arm, and a glass in hand. He sets the glass on the table, and opens both of the cans. With great care he measures out each of the pale beers in the glass. It glows for just a moment.</p>
<p>"that'll fix yer right up, son", he says, handing you the glass.</p>

<p>She was a little girl and would play in the woods. The trail was hardly visible but she knew every inch of it by heart. It wound around the trees down to the creek. There was a door by the creek. A dark door. It whispered to her. Fingers emerged from its inky blackness forming into a hand, reaching out to her.</p>
<p>She woke up in a sweat</p>
